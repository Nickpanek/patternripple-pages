Prepare metadata: - `title`, `slug`, `sku`, `price` - `category` + `subcategory` (see `collections.ts`) - `description`, `altText`, `tags` - `stripePriceId` 2. Generate: - Product page: `app/p/{slug}/page.tsx` - JSON summary: `data/{slug}.json` - Index entry: append to `app/data/products.json` 3. Upload product assets to: `https://files.patternripple.com/{slug}-preview.jpg` `https://files.patternripple.com/{slug}-mockup1.jpg` … `mockup11.jpg` `https://files.patternripple.com/{slug}-thumb.jpg` 4.

The `BuyButton` dynamically loads and handles checkout: ```tsx const BuyButton = dynamic(() => import("@/components/BuyButton"), { ssr: false }); <BuyButton priceId={stripePriceId} sku={product.sku} /> ``` 🔒 Licensing Products can be: Exclusive (one-time buyer, removed from marketplace) Non-exclusive (multiple licenses sold) Exclusive products generate a certificate of authenticity. 🤝 Contributing Pull requests are welcome.
