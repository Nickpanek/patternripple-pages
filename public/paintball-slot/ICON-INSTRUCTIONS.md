# PWA Icon Instructions

The app requires two icon files for PWA functionality:

- **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
- **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Icon Generation Options:

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo/image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
5. Place them in the `/public/paintball-slot/` folder

### Option 2: Use Your Patch Images
Simply copy one of your existing patch images and resize it:
- Copy `morelo1.jpg` or any patch image you like
- Resize to 192x192 and save as `icon-192.png`
- Resize to 512x512 and save as `icon-512.png`

### Option 3: Create Simple Icons
Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.):
- Create a 192x192 square with your brand colors
- Add "TS" or a small version of your logo
- Export as PNG
- Repeat for 512x512

## Recommended Design:
- Background: Camo green (#4a5c3a) or tactical tan (#c5b896)
- Text/Logo: Gold (#d4af37)
- Keep it simple - small icons need to be clear
- Avoid fine details that won't be visible at small sizes

## Temporary Placeholder:
Until you create icons, the app will still work but won't show a custom icon when installed on mobile devices.
