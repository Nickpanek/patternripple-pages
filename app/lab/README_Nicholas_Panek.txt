1. PURPOSE OF DISCLOSURE (THE "TROLL SHIELD")
Nicholas Panek publishes this research to establish comprehensive Prior Art for the chemical space encompassing the LAZ-series scaffolds. The intent is to prevent "patent trolls" or third-party entities from claiming exclusive rights to these molecules or their obvious variations by placing the structures, methodologies, and technical discoveries into the public domain.

2. TECHNICAL SCOPE & MARKUSH FAMILY
This disclosure extends beyond specific molecules to the entire chemical genus defined by Formula (I):

Core — (X) — (Y)

* Core: A five-membered aromatic nitrogen heterocycle (specifically imidazole or triazole).
* X and Y: Independent 1,3-dioxolane rings (specifically isopropylidene glycerol scaffolds).
* Substitution: At least one dioxolane ring comprises an R group, where R is selected from H, C1-C6 alkyl, or C1-C6 alkoxy.

Embodiment 1 (LAZ-1011): CC1(C)OCC(c2cn(C3COC(C)(C)OC3)cn2)CO1
Embodiment 2 (LAZ-1123): COC1(C)OCC(n2cnc(C3COC(C)(C)OC3)c2)CO1

3. CLAIM OF NON-OBVIOUS TECHNICAL ADVANTAGE
Nicholas Panek identifies and discloses a specific, unexpected technical advantage of this family: the Globular 3D-Architecture.

* Efflux Evasion: The high Fraction Csp3 (0.80) creates a non-planar geometry that limits recognition and ejection by the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system in Gram-negative pathogens.
* Targeting: These scaffolds are disclosed for the inhibition of bacterial Methionine Aminopeptidase (MetAP).

4. METHODOLOGY & REPLICATION
This research was generated using RDKit (2025.9.3).
* Canonicalization: All SMILES strings are provided in standard canonical form to ensure unambiguous identification in chemical registries.
* Validation: Molecular properties were validated through in silico filters including PAINS and BRENK to confirm the absence of known toxicophores.
